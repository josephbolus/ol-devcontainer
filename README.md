# MySQL Devcontainer Sandbox

This repo provisions a VS Code devcontainer with a MySQL primary/replica pair and a utility
workspace container (`devcontainer-app`). SSH access is baked into the DB containers so you can
shell in, copy files, or mount them via SFTP/SSHFS from inside the workspace container.

## Containers

- `devcontainer-app`: Ubuntu 22.04 with MySQL Shell, client tools, and the SSH client. VS Code
  attaches here (`remoteUser` = `vscode`).
- `mysql-primary` and `mysql-replica`: Rocky Linux 9 images built from `.devcontainer/mysql
  /Dockerfile.mysql`. Each runs `mysqld` and `sshd` under supervisord with data persisted at
  `/data/mysql`.

## SSH usage from the workspace container

After the devcontainer starts (or after running
`.devcontainer/scripts/setup-ssh-client.sh`) you can:

```bash
ssh mysql-primary
ssh mysql-replica

scp ./some-file.sql mysql-primary:/tmp/
scp mysql-replica:/var/log/mysqld.log ./logs/

printf 'ls\n' | sftp mysql-primary
```

Aliases `mysql-primary` and `mysql-replica` come from `.devcontainer/ssh/config` and use the
ED25519 key stored at `~/.ssh/devcontainer-mysql-ed25519` inside `devcontainer-app`.
The same key is installed in the MySQL containers for the non-root `dev` user.

## Rotating SSH keys

The key pair under `.devcontainer/ssh/` is generated by the post-create hook and ignored by Git.
To rotate it:

1. Delete the files in `.devcontainer/ssh/` (or replace them with your own).
2. Re-run `.devcontainer/scripts/setup-ssh-client.sh` inside `devcontainer-app`.
3. Restart the MySQL containers: `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml restart
   mysql-primary mysql-replica`.

This sequence regenerates the ED25519 key pair, updates `authorized_keys`, and refreshes the
workspace SSH client configuration.

## Database automation

- `.devcontainer/mysql/setup-db.sh` seeds the primary/replica and configures replication.
- `.devcontainer/mysql/verify-replication.sh` validates status and data sync; it runs on every
  devcontainer start and should be executed manually before changes are committed.

```
$ bash .devcontainer/mysql/setup-db.sh
$ bash .devcontainer/mysql/verify-replication.sh
